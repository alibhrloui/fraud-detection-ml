## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd credit-card-fraud-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the project, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, train a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluate its performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis section explores the dataset, providing insights into its structure and characteristics. Key statistics and visualizations are used to understand the distribution of features and identify patterns.

## Modeling

The modeling section utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to build a fraud detection model. The trained model is then used to make predictions on a test set.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Matthews correlation coefficient. A confusion matrix is visualized to provide an overview of the model's predictions.
